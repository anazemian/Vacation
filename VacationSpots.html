    <h1>Top 10 Vacation Spots</h1>
  <ul>

  <div>
    <p class="kingston"><h2>Kingston, Jamaica</h2> Places to see - Bob Marley Museum, Emancipation Park, Blue Mountains</p>
    <p class="kingston">The best time to visit Jamaica is October to mid-December. That's when the island's already beautiful weather (ranging from mid-70s to the high 80s all year-round) is the most pleasant and the hotel and flight deals are the easiest to find. Rates are also cheap during the summer, but you'll risk the wrath of hurricane season. January to March is the peak travel season to the island — room rates can spike to more than $700 USD per night at some hotels.</p>

    <p class="kingston"><h2>Cairns, Austrailia</h2>Places to see - The Great Barrier Reef, Daintree Rainforest, Fitzroy Island National Park</p>
    <p class="kingston">Every month of the year offers something different here in Cairns. While the summer is hot and wet the waterfalls are in full splendour and the rainforest is amazing, everything is so Green. The bird life is also spectacular. Our winter offers mild temperatures and probably is the most popular time to visit. My favourite months would probably be September and October.</p>

    <p class="kingston"><h2>Boracay, Philipines</h2>Places to see - Ariel's Point, White Beach, Yapak Beach</p>
    <p class="kingston">Most people flock to Boracay between December all the way to May. We’re not only talking foreign tourists but also locals because school is off and long vacations from work are usually during Christmas time and the Lenten season. It is when the sun is hottest and for travelers with a real itch for the beach, this season just makes the sea and the sand a bit more tempting. The crystal waters and the fine, powdery white sand seem to glow and shine.</p>

    <p class="kingston"><h2>Beirut, Lebanon</h2>Places to see - Zaintunay Bay, National Museum of Beirut, Hamra Street</p>
    <p class="kingston">Beirut rarely gets cold, but it can be rainy in winter. Visit in April, when the weather is dry and you can ski at Faraya and sunbathe on the coast on the same day.</p>

      <p class="kingston"><h2>Oahu, Hawaii</h2>Places to see - Pearl Harbor, Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve, USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park</p>
      <p class="kingston">Oahu has great weather year-round and many proclaim it has the best weather of all the islands. Maybe that's why almost half of all visitors to the state of Hawaii pick Oahu. Or maybe it's because Oahu is very well the most scenic of all the islands, or... well that list could go on and on. Oahu is a great choice for visitors!</p>

      <p class="kingston"><h2>Munich, Germany</h2>Places to see - Oktoberfest, English Garden, BMW Museum</p>
      <p class="kingston">The best time to visit Munich is from March to May: fall's crowds have long since departed, and summer’s peak season hasn’t yet hit. But if you’re one of the millions who want to party at Oktoberfest, you’ll need to pack a coat.</p>

    <div>
      <p class="kingston"><h2>Venice, Italy</h2>Places to see - Carnaval of Venice, Grand Canal, Dodges' Palace</p>
      <p class="kingston">The best time to visit Venice is from September to November when tourists desert the city. Although the temperatures — which range from the upper 30s to mid-70s — necessitate some warm weather wear, the lowered hotel rates and the barren canals make it worth it.</p>

      <p class="kingston"><h2>Grand Canyon Skywalk</h2>Places to see - The Skywalk</p>
      <p class="kingston">The Skywalk is a long drive from both the South Rim and the North Rim, inconveniencing many wishing to stay near the Grand Canyon Village. As one TripAdvisor traveler says, "Be forewarned that this is an all-day activity because it is a long drive from anywhere."</p>

      <p class="kingston"><h2>Four Corners, USA</h2>Places to see - Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah</p>
      <p class="kingston">The four western states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico meet at Four Corners Monument, a Navajo Nation park and monument accessible from all four states. It's the only place in the country where four states come together. The region, uniting the canyons, buttes and high desert trails that weave through northwest New Mexico, northeast Arizona, southeast Utah and southwest Colorado, is best visited in late spring, summer or early fall.</p>

      <p class="kingston"><h2>Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe</h2>Places to see - Victoria Falls Bridge, Crocodile Ranch, Mosi-oa-Tunya / Victoria Falls National Park</p>
      <p class="kingston">The best time to visit the spectacular Victoria Falls is from February to May, directly after the region’s summer rains, when you’ll see the world’s largest sheet of falling water flowing at its greatest volume. It’s roughly twice the height of North America's Niagara Falls, and the thunderous roar can be heard for miles around. The sheer force of the water drives a column of spray far into the air, drenching the edge of the falls in a fine mist.</p>
